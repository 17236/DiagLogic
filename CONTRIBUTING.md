# Contributing

DiagLogic is a method-first repository. It prioritizes correctness, safety, and explainability over features.

## What we accept
- Fixes for typos and clarity (without changing meaning)
- Improvements to documentation structure
- Additional test cases ONLY if they do not introduce advice/recommendations

## What we do NOT accept
- Chat interfaces, conversational UX, “assistant” behavior
- Parts replacement recommendations or prescriptive actions
- Confidence scores / rankings / probability outputs
- Any bypass of gating logic or boundaries
- “Just make it simpler” changes that hide uncertainty

## Contribution rules
1. Changes must preserve the “report, not chat” output model.
2. Every new statement must be traceable to explicit evidence gates or to a stated data gap.
3. If in doubt, the default is to stop (refuse) rather than guess.

## Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the repository license.
